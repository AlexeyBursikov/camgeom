# camgeom
Course materials for MIPT Camera Geometry for Scene Reconstruction course (Cognitive Technologies)

### Practical Task 1: geometry_and_monocular
Basic principles of pinhole camera projection and Homographies are illustrated.
The final task is to project image points from lidar to camera on example from KITTI dataset

### Practical Task 2: camera_calibration
Camera calibration with a chessboard pattern is performed, using opencv gradients calculation as well as numerical derivatives.
Optimisation is performed via scipy.optimize

### Practical Task 3: depth_map
This is an illustration of how depth map is calculated using opencv SGBM functions. It doesn't contain programming taks, but requires answering some theoretical questions.
